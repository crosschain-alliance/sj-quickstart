# sj-quickstart

Welcome to the **sj-quickstart** repository! In this guide, we‚Äôll walk you through creating a SafeJunction agent that
functions as an **Ethereum Gas Price Oracle**. The goal of this agent is to retrieve the `baseFeePerGas` value from the
latest Ethereum mainnet block and provide it to a Solidity contract deployed on the Sepolia testnet.

This is accomplished by leveraging the **SafeJunction platform**, which enables seamless data retrieval across different
environments by utilizing one agent's output as another's input.

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   First, create an `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content. This will store the necessary
   keys for deployment and interaction with the Ethereum network:

   ```bash
   PRIVATE_KEY=
   ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=
   SEPOLIA_JSON_RPC_URL=
   ```

   - **PRIVATE_KEY**: Your wallet's private key.
   - **ETHERSCAN_API_KEY**: Your Etherscan API key (for contract verification and gas estimation).
   - **SEPOLIA_JSON_RPC_URL**: The JSON-RPC URL for the Sepolia testnet.

2. **Compile the Contracts**

   Once the environment variables are set, compile the Solidity contracts using Hardhat:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. **Deploy the `BaseFeePerGasOracle` Contract**

   After compilation, you can deploy the `BaseFeePerGasOracle` contract to the Sepolia network using the following
   command:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat BaseFeePerGasOracle:deploy \
   --gateway <gateway-address> \
   --network sepolia
   ```

   - Replace `<gateway-address>` with the actual address of the gateway you'll be using.

4. **Execute and Read the Result**

   To execute the agent and retrieve the `baseFeePerGas` from the Ethereum mainnet, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat BaseFeePerGasOracle:execAndReadBaseFeePerGas \
   --gateway <gateway-address> \
   --oracle <oracle-address> \
   --network sepolia
   ```

   - Replace `<gateway-address>` with the actual address of the gateway you'll be using.
   - Replace `<oracle-address>` with the actual deployed address of your `BaseFeePerGasOracle` contract.

## Example Output

When you run the `BaseFeePerGasOracle:execAndReadBaseFeePerGas` command, you might see output similar to the following:

```
exec transaction sent: 0x335ffaab8033ca9c343f22f36e1d869464f8fe541450cda85df77f9e941152a8
